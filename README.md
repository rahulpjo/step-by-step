# Step By Step

## Project Description

Step By Step is a blog/social networking app with the mission of celebrating not the final product itself, but the steps to the final product. The app is meant for skill builders in any discipline to showcase the way they practice their skill and lets other users comment with praise or constructive criticism/tips.

## Project Stack

The project leverages React and Redux on the front-end with FastAPI on the server side, which is connected to a SQLite database via SQLAlchemy.
